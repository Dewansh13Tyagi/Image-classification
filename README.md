Binary image classifier that detects happy vs. sad emotions using a CNN built with TensorFlow/Keras.
 A deep learning model built with TensorFlow/Keras to classify images into two categories: happy and sad. Trained on a custom dataset, the model uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for accurate emotion recognition. Includes scripts for training, evaluation, and saving in the modern .keras format.
